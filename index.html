            <p class="font-baloo justify">Steve Paul Jobs was born in the year of 1955 in San Francisco. American
                businessman
                and computer scientist, who also created one of the most recognized companies worldwide in the world of
                computing, such as Apple Computer; a genius without a doubt who left us a great legacy.</p>
            <h3 class="font-oswald">Steve Jobs</h3>
            <p class="font-baloo justify">The lack of experience and youth of his parents led them to give him up for
                adoption to Clara and Paul, a
                young married couple who were in charge of forming in him a warrior and fighting spirit.

                Surely the place that housed it from a very young age had a lot to do with the love and dedication it
                showed for everything related to technology, since Mountain View is one of the Californian cities, where
                the heart of the electronic industry of U.S.
                <br><br>
                He received his first notions in the field of computing thanks to the Hewlett-Packard Explorer Club;
                More formally, he entered the Homestead Institute in his city, to later access one of Oregon's
                universities, Reed College, where he did not last long and abandoned his career.

                He traveled to India and on his return Atari hired him as a designer, this was the pioneering company in
                the field of video games.</p>
            <h3 class="font-oswald">HOW WAS APPLE BORN?</h3>
            <p class="font-baloo justify">Its abilities and skills in the computer, made Stephen Wozniak take advantage
                of all this potential and
                formed a society that started very modestly and by leaps and bounds, so much so that the Apple I was the
                reference in history as the number one personal computer.
                <br><br>
                His favorite fruit is the apple, and he has been responsible for such a peculiar name that he assigned
                in 1976 to his company, Apple Computer; But this was only its beginning, since several versions of Apple
                were created later, always surpassing the previous one.

                Due to some conflicts, the company dissolved and a massive dismissal of employees opened a new direction
                for Jobs, who, far from being cowed, continued with his business mission. So much so that NeXT Computer
                was another of the computer companies that founded this man in 1985 and in 1986, Pixar the cartoon
                studios.
                <br><br>
                A successful path and full of surprises in the computer field is something that this genius never tired
                of generating, with his potential, creativity and avant-garde talent in various areas, where elegance
                and simplicity always prevailed.
                <br><br>
                Steve Jobs began to manifest significant health problems in 2009, for which he had to receive a liver
                transplant and it was pancreatic cancer or Kaposi's sarcoma, something that is still controversial
                (since there are different versions of this) , which finally led to his death at 56 years of age, on
                October 5, 2011.</p>
